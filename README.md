# 12 Character Text Kernel

The following is a 12-character text kernel for the Atari 2600 that, although flickery, is usable.

I am uncertain about the identity of the original author of this kernel, but it is utilized in the following projects:
* https://github.com/tdididit/a26-flashcart
* https://github.com/robinhedwards/UnoCart-2600

Please find a screenshot of the kernel here: ![Screenshot](https://github.com/dadecoza/atari2600-text-kernel/blob/main/text.png?raw=true)
